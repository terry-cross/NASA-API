The coding for this project references the following sites:

https://api.nasa.gov  

For the purposes of this project, Shopify is extending our mission to Make Commerce Better for Everyone to include the whole entire universe. Please build us an app to help share photos from one of NASA’s image APIs.
The Challenge
We need a webpage that can pull images, and allow the user to “like” and “unlike” their favourite images.

We'd like a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:
Fetch data from one of NASA’s APIs and display the resulting images (more details under Technical Requirements)
Display descriptive data for each image (for example: title, date, description, etc.)
Like an image
Unlike an image
Technical requirements
Search results should come from NASA’s free APIs, for which you’ll need a free API key from https://api.nasa.gov - 
you do not need to enter anything more than your first name, last name, and email address (i.e. application url is not required)
We’ve provided screenshots below of demo apps we built using the Astronomy Picture of the Day or Mars Rover Photos APIs (along with Shopify’s open source React component library: Polaris). 
You are free to use any NASA API you like
You are free to use any front end framework/component library you like (or none at all!)
Each image result should list at least a title, date of capture (ideally in earth_date) and a button to “like” that image.
Each image can be “liked”, and a user should be able to undo their “like”
The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic (MDN reference)
